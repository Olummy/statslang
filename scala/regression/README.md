Scala linear regression example
===============================

The code uses "sbt" as the build tool. See the "monte-carlo" directory for details of how to run sbt.

Just typing "run" at the sbt prompt will compile and run the code. Typing "test" will compile and run the tests. Typing "console" will give a Scala REPL with a properly configured class path. Type "help" at the sbt prompt for help on sbt. Type ":help" at the Scala REPL for help on the REPL.

The build file is "build.sbt". The code is in the directory "src/main/scala/regression/" - the file containing the "main" method is "Regression.scala". Tests are in "src/test/scala/".
