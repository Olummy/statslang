LaTeX slides and Scala code for the 2014 RSS Statistical Computing Section Meeting on languages for statistical computing

The directory "slides" contains the LaTeX source code for the PDF slides presented at the meeting. It should also contain a pre-compiled PDF of the talk.

The directory "monte-carlo" contains the Monte Carlo example from the talk.

The directory "regression" contains the linear regression example from the talk.

Note that this repo contains everything that is needed to build and run the Scala code examples on any system that has Java installed. Any recent version of Java is fine. You do not need to "install" Scala or any Scala "packages" in order to run the code. If you have Java and a decent internet connection, you are good to go. This is one of the benefits of Scala - you can run it anywhere, on any system with a Java installation. Further explanation is given in the talk slides.

To check if you have Java installed, just run:

java -version

at your system command prompt. If you get an error, Java is absent or incorrectly installed. Installing Java is very easy on any platform, but the best way to install it depends on exactly what OS you are running, so search the internet for advice on the best way to install Java on your OS.

Once you have Java installed, try the "monte-carlo" example first, as it is a bit simpler than the "regression" example. See the README file in the "monte-carlo" directory for specific details.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub and are viewing this README on the GitHub website, just click on the "Download ZIP" button on the right and extract it somewhere in your local filesystem to get all of the code needed to run the examples.
