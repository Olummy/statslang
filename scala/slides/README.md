Slides for Scala talk
=====================

On any system with "make", "latex", "pdflatex" and the "beamer" latex class, it should be possible to build the PDF of the talk by typing "make" at the command line.

However, you will first need to run the Scala example in the "regression" directory in order to generate some of the required plots.

There is also a pre-built PDF in the directory for those without a LaTeX environment.
